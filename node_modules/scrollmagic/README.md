# ScrollMagic v2.0.8 +fix

This is forked from the original <a href="https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic">ScrollMagic plugin</a> as of 07-Jun-2021 for a school project, and won't be updated to v3 (probably).

The reason is to make it work in Nuxt/Vuejs, applying the fixes suggested <a href="https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic/issues/665#issuecomment-558239420">here</a>, and deploy the package on Heroku so it installs this custom-made repo instead of the original ScrollMagic which causes the Heroku build to fail.

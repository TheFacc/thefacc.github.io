# PLUGINS

This [directory](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/plugins) contains JS plugins to run before mounting the root Vue.js application.

- (ACTIVE) functions.js = global functions to be injected in all components
- (INACTIVE) chroma.js/scrollmagic.js = used to import external plugins (not used in current project implementation)
